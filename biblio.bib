abstract={Mobile devices have now become indispensable and ubiquitous enablers for collaboration. Such a ubiquity increases concerns over the resilience of existing mobile authentication methods and their ability to safeguard the growing amount of sensitive information stored and processed on these devices. Conventional knowledge-based authentication techniques such as PINs, passwords and pattern locks are inadequate to fully realize the current needs of the users due to low user-friendliness and insufficient security. One approach to enhance user-friendliness is to enable authentication merely for sensitive and critical applications, thereby not requiring users to inconveniently authenticate on the device every time it is accessed for e.g., while accessing low security applications such as games, news, and entertainment. However, knowledge-based techniques fail to deliver strong security guarantees for sensitive applications as they are vulnerable to classic cyber-attacks such as brute-force, social engineering, shoulder surfing, and smudge etc. Physiological biometrics such as fingerprint, voice or facial recognition can enable user-friendly and strong security, but they only provide single-shot authentication and lack ability to continuously authenticate the user. In this effort, we take a different approach by designing a multi-faceted authentication scheme termed as mAuth that continuously and unobtrusively authenticates the user while the device is being in contact with the user. By leveraging a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning techniques on the raw low-level sensor data from the mobile device, multiple inferences about the user (or higher-level contexts) such as the frequently visited locations, physical proximity with the device (carrying in the pocket or placed on the table), and gait patterns are extracted. These multiple high-level contexts regarding the user are further fused to generate a dynamic trust score that determines the degree to which- the user is trustworthy to access the applications. Experiments demonstrate the performance of the individual learning algorithms as well as the overall method in identifying users under natural settings. Various attack scenarios targeting mobile devices are designed to prove the security of the proposed approach. We also explore ways to unobtrusively acquire data for supervised learning algorithms without explicit user annotation.},

abstract={Smartphones and tablets have become ubiquitous in our daily lives. Smartphones, in particular, have become more than personal assistants. These devices have provided new avenues for consumers to play, work, and socialize whenever and wherever they want. Smartphones are small in size, so they are easy to handle and to stow and carry in users' pockets or purses. However, mobile devices are also susceptible to various problems. One of the greatest concerns is the possibility of breach in security and privacy if the device is seized by an outside party. It is possible that threats can come from friends as well as strangers. Due to the size of smart devices, they can be easily lost and may expose details of users' private lives. In addition, this might enable pervasive observation or imitation of one's movements and activities, such as sending messages to contacts, accessing private communication, shopping with a credit card, and relaying information about where one has been. This paper highlights the potential risks that occur when smartphones are stolen or seized, discusses the concept of continuous authentication, and analyzes current approaches and mechanisms of behavioral biometrics with respect to methodology, associated datasets and evaluation approaches.},

abstract={With the ubiquity of location based services and applications, large volume of mobility data has been generated routinely, usually from heterogeneous data sources, such as different GPS-embedded devices, mobile apps or location based service providers. In this paper, we investigate efficient ways of identifying users across such heterogeneous data sources. We present a MapReduce-based framework called Automatic User Identification (AUI) which is easy to deploy and can scale to very large data set. Our framework is based on a novel similarity measure called the signal based similarity (SIG) which measures the similarity of users' trajectories gathered from different data sources, typically with very different sampling rates and noise patterns. We conduct extensive experimental evaluations, which show that our framework outperforms the existing methods significantly. Our study on one hand provides an effective approach for the mobility data integration problem on large scale data sets, i.e., combining the mobility data sets from different sources in order to enhance the data quality. On the other hand, our study provides an in-depth investigation for the widely studied human mobility uniqueness problem under heterogeneous data sources.},

abstract={For the past two decades, as the role of computer technology has expanded, computer security (secure processors, information encryption, network protection with biometrics) has also become increasingly important [1-21]. Many computer security schemes have been developed over this time period; however, none of these are foolproof yet. A username and pass-word combination is one of the most popular approaches to securing a computer system, but this system is vulnerable because passwords can be stolen or cracked. However, research suggests that it is possible to identify a user based strictly on their typing style, using pattern recognition, neural networks, and other techniques. This paper focuses on using the keyboard dynamics of the user's password to add an extra layer of security to the natural log-in process.},

abstract={With the increased popularity of smartphones, various security threats and privacy leakages targeting them are discovered and investigated. In this work, we present SilentSense, a framework to authenticate users silently and transparently by exploiting dynamics mined from the user touch behavior biometrics and the micro-movement of the device caused by user's screen-touch actions. We build a “touch-based biometrics” model of the owner by extracting some principle features, and then verify whether the current user is the owner or guest/attacker. When using the smartphone, some unique operating dynamics of the user is detected and learnt by collecting the sensor data and touch events silently. When users are mobile, the micro-movement of mobile devices caused by touch is suppressed by that due to the large scale user-movement which will render the touch-based biometrics ineffective. To address this, we integrate a movement-based biometrics for each user with previous touch-based biometrics. We conduct extensive evaluations of our approaches on the Android smartphone, we show that the user identification accuracy is over 99\%.},

After this, we have enhanced the lips image using a color transformation, and next we do its detection. The parameterization is based on lips contour points. Those points have been transformed by a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) kernel, using a minimization of Fisher Score. Finally, a one-versus-all multiclass supervised approach based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) is applied as a classifier. A database with 50 users and 10 samples per class has been built. A cross-validation strategy have been applied in our experiments, reaching success rates up to 99.6\%, using four lip training samples per class, and evaluating with six lip test samples. This success was found using a shape of 150 points, with 40 states in Hidden Markov Model and a RBF kernel for a supervised approach based on Support Vector Machines.},

abstract={The research presented in This work describes audio-visual speaker identification experiments carried out on a large data set of 251 subjects. Both the audio and visual modeling is carried out using hidden Markov models. The visual modality uses the speaker's lip information. The audio and visual modalities are both degraded to emulate a train/test mismatch. The fusion method employed adapts automatically by using classifier score reliability estimates of both modalities to give improved audio-visual accuracies at all tested levels of audio and visual degradation, compared to the individual audio or visual modality accuracies. A maximum visual identification accuracy of 86\% was achieved. This result is comparable to the performance of systems using the entire face, and suggests the hypothesis that the system described would be tolerant to varying facial expression, since only the information around the speaker's lips is employed.},

abstract={User Identification and User Verification are the primary problems in the area of Keystroke Dynamics. In the last decade there has been massive research in User Verification, and lesser research in User Identification. Both approaches take a username and a passphrase as input. In this paper, we introduce this problem of replacing authentication systems with the passphrase alone. This is done by using neural network based approach i.e. Extreme Learning Machine. ELM is a fast Single hidden layer feed forward network (SLFN) with good generalization performance. However the hidden layer in ELM does not have to be tuned. As an evolutionary step, we use a clustering based Semi-supervised approach (ECM-ELM) to User Recognition to combat variance in the accuracy of traditional ELMs. This research aims not only to address User Recognition problem but also to remove the instability in the accuracy of ELM. As per our simulation, ECM-ELM achieved a stable accuracy of 87\% with the CMU Keystroke Dataset, while ELM achieved an unstable average accuracy of 90\%.},

abstract={The massive explosion and ubiquity of computing devices and the outreach of the web have been the most defining events of the century so far. As more and more people gain access to the internet, traditional know-something and have-something authentication methods such as PINs and passwords are proving to be insufficient for prohibiting unauthorized access to increasingly personal data on the web. Therefore, the need of the hour is a user-verification system that is not only more reliable and secure, but also unobtrusive and minimalistic. Keystroke Dynamics is a novel Biometric Technique, it is not only unobtrusive, but also transparent and inexpensive. The fusion of keystroke dynamics and Face Recognition engenders the most desirable characteristics of a verification system. Our implementation uses Hidden Markov Models (HMM) for modeling the Keystroke Dynamics, with the help of two widely used Feature Vectors: Keypress Latency and Keypress Duration. On the other hand, Face Recognition makes use of the traditional Eigenfaces approach. The results show that the system has a high precision, with a False Acceptance Rate of 5.4\% and a False Rejection Rate of 9.2\%. Moreover, it is also future-proof, as the hardware requirements, i.e. camera and keyboard (physical or on-screen), have become an indispensable part of modern computing.},

abstract={Most computer systems authenticate users only once at the time of initial login, which can lead to security concerns. Continuous authentication has been explored as an approach for alleviating such concerns. Previous methods for continuous authentication primarily use biometrics, e.g., fingerprint and face recognition, or behaviometrics, e.g., key stroke patterns. We describe CABA, a novel continuous authentication system that is inspired by and leverages the emergence of sensors for pervasive and continuous health monitoring. CABA authenticates users based on their BioAura, an ensemble of biomedical signal streams that can be collected continuously and non-invasively using wearable medical devices. While each such signal may not be highly discriminative by itself, we demonstrate that a collection of such signals, along with robust machine learning, can provide high accuracy levels. We demonstrate the feasibility of CABA through analysis of traces from the MIMIC-II dataset. We propose various applications of CABA, and describe how it can be extended to user identification and adaptive access control authorization. Finally, we discuss possible attacks on the proposed scheme and suggest corresponding countermeasures.},

abstract={General-purpose computing on graphics processing units (GPGPU) is popular computing technology to utilize in various fields. In the paper, we parallelize cryptographical hash processing of a password cracking tool, John the Ripper, by utilizing CUDA on GPGPU. We also evaluate our work to compare the processing time of hash processing parallelized by GPU with that of the John the Ripper on a dual-core CPU. Processing time of our implementation is 0.03\% of that of the original one.},

  title={Low-effort place recognition with WiFifingerprints using deep learning},
  author = {Nowicki, Micha{\textbackslash}l and Wietrzykowski, Jan},
  place={Institute of Control and Information Engineering,Poznan University of Technology},
  abstract={Using WiFi signals for indoor localization is the main localization modality of the existing personal indoor localization systems operating on mobile devices. WiFi fingerprinting is also used for mobile robots, as WiFi signals are usually available indoors and can provide rough initial position estimate or can be used together with other positioning systems. Currently, the best solutions rely on filtering, manual data analysis, and time-consuming parameter tuning to achieve reliable and accurate localization. In this work, we propose to use deep neural networks to significantly lower the work-force burden of the localization system design, while still achieving satisfactory results. Assuming the state-of-the-art hierarchical approach, we employ the DNN system for building/floor classification. We show that stacked autoencoders allow to efficiently reduce the feature space in order to achieve robust and precise classification. The proposed architecture is verified on the publicly available UJIIndoorLoc dataset and the results are compared with other solutions},

  title={FreeSense:Indoor Human Identification with WiFi Signals},
  author={Tong Xin, Bin Guo, Zhu Wang, Mingyang Li, Zhiwen Yu},
  place={School of Computer Science Northwestern Polytechnical University Xi\’an, P. R. China},
  abstract={Human identification plays an important role in human-computer interaction. There have been numerous methods proposed for human identification (e.g., face recognition, gait recognition, fingerprint identification, etc.). While these methods could be very useful under different conditions, they also suffer from certain shortcomings (e.g., user privacy, sensing coverage range). In this paper, we propose a novel approach for human identification, which leverages WIFI signals to enable non-intrusive human identification in domestic environments. It is based on the observation that each person has specific influence patterns to the surrounding WIFI signal while moving indoors, regarding their body shape characteristics and motion patterns. The influence can be captured by the Channel State Information (CSI) time series of WIFI. Specifically, a combination of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) techniques is used for CSI waveform-based human identification. We implemented the system in a 6m*5m smart home environment and recruited 9 users for data collection and evaluation. Experimental results indicate that the identification accuracy is about 88.9 to 94.5 per cent when the candidate user set changes from 6 to 2, showing that the proposed human identification method is effective in domestic environments.},
